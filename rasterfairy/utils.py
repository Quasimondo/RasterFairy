"""
This module is currently minimal but is intended to house utility functions
for the Raster Fairy library. As the library evolves, common helper functions
or utility classes may be placed here to support various components of the
Raster Fairy toolkit.

The file was previously used for `cmp_to_key` before it was removed.
"""

# This file is intentionally left blank after removing cmp_to_key.
# If other utility functions were present, they would remain here.
